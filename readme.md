# CWO Tools
This is intended as a small selection of tools for use for sailing instructors teaching according to the [CWO](https://www.cwo.nl) system.

# Building instructions
In order to build the project run the following commands:
```
npm install
npm run production
```
This will create a production ready environment in `./dist`.

# Future Ideas
In the future I would like to add a lesson planner tool amongst other features. Suggestions for future features are always welcome.
