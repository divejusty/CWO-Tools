# CWO Tools
This is intended as a small selection of tools for use for sailing instructors teaching according to the [CWO](https://www.cwo.nl) system.

# Building instructions
In order to build the project run the following commands:
```
npm install
npm run production
```
This will create a production ready environment in 'dist' 

# Future Ideas
Some ideas I would like to look at in the future, kind of split based on what kind of work it is, but in no particular order.

## Major developments
* Update/Extend requirement lists
* Further incorporate Tailwind
	* Also include light/dark mode support
* More robust storage method
* Lesson planner
* Automatic testing
	* Maybe integrate with GitHub Actions

## Minor developments
* Create endpoint for Requirements files, allowing for versioning using Mix
* Figure out something to automatically set last update date or version number
* Set up linting / style enforcement
* Expand Readme
	* Add Requirements
