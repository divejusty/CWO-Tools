# CWO Tools
This is intended as a small selection of tools for use for sailing instructors teaching according to the [CWO](https://www.cwo.nl) system.

# Future Ideas
Some ideas I would like to look at in the future, kind of split based on what kind of work it is, but in no particular order.

## Major developments
* Update/Extend requirement lists
* Improve styling stuff and extract more values into variables
* More robust storage method
* Lesson planner

## Minor developments
* Split vendor stuff in Mix
* Create endpoint for Requirements files, allowing for versioning using Mix
